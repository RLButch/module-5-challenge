This code was created using a combination of sources including matplotlib and stack overflow
Additionally code from class activities and generated through tutorial sessions
## Analysis

- There is a positive correlation of 0.84 between mouse weight (g) and tumor size (mm3). This pvalue of 0.84 illustrates a linear correlation displayed in the scatterplot at the end of this analysis. Suggesting that in order to reduce tumor size in mice, a healthy weight is essential.
- The most effective drug regimen is Capomulin in treating tumor size (mm3). For mouse Y793 tumor size decreased over time under the Capomulin regime
- The least effective drug was Infubinol which was the only treatment with outliers, placing some doubt around the treatment, Ramicane was the third least effective treatment compared to Capomulin, Ceftamin was also an effective treatment. Capomulin and Ceftamin could be recommended as effective treatment regimes in mice and possibly ready for human trials.
